							<h2>Reflection 9/21/22 (Checking of test paper)</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Sir Alvic let us check our test paper. With that we are able to check our exam results and to know our
								mistakes. I thought before that the exam is same with the quiz that was given to us. I have a lot of
								mistakes specially in the first page where the questions seem complicated to me. somewhere around
								the 2 nd page. 2 nd page for me was bit easier than. And the true or false part is a smooth sailing I got it all
								almost perfect.</p><br>
								<br>							
							<h2>THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK</h2>
							<p>Since the technology was born. My life made easier. Over the years from just analog technology to
								digital technology, life has been a few clicks away. I can now order food via online or find locations. With
								the advantage of technology. Many of its users are now a victim of this online fraud, scam, phising and
								other hacking activities. People with highly knowledge about technology uses their skills to take over an
								account of a computer system. Clicking a website or clicking a random link online can stole my cookie
								session, or implant virus to my computer which steals Bank number, pin and/or passwords. Being wise
								online and thinking before i click us the best thing to do.<br>
								<br>
								
							<h2>THE FUTURE HAS ARRIVED. NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A PLACE IN IT</h2>
							<br>
							The future has now arrived! Since today is a computer age. I think I am knowledgeable enough with in
							terms of technology and sorting fact or false information online. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of trends online that I
							want to try. One of the is the online money or the crypto currency. This thing called bitcoin can helps us
							gain money. i must be updated when it comes to technology for me to have a place wnd will not left
							behind.
