							<h2>Shift from Traditional/Teacher-Centered to Student-Centered Education</h2>
                            <img src="https://busyteacher.org/uploads/posts/2013-03/1362362871_stu.jpg" width="600px" height='500px'>
							<p>As a student, who have undergone and experience a traditional/ conventional type of education, I also
								have lots of adjustments from the shift that happened. As we all know, we are now living in a 21st
								Century world, where these following skills: communicative, collaborative, creative and critic thinkers
								are what we are required to possess due to the demand in today&#39;s generation.<br>
								<br>
								
								From the conventional teaching and learning process, we, the students are used to be immersed back
								then in a kind of environment where traditional, old and conventional teaching styles and strategies are
								employed. That&#39;s why it emphasizes a teacher-centered education where teachers are the sage on the
								stage, not guide on the side. But now, a learner-centered education is mostly encouraged as it give the
								learners an opportunity to become the center of the teaching and learning process.<br>
								<br>
								
								We can&#39;t deny the fact that today&#39;s generation is really a modernized one, not just in the educational
								setting, but as well as to other aspects of life. One of the areas/ field that is greatly affected with this
								shift is the education of the students. Though we can&#39;t be living in a world where we forget what we
								used to do, we can&#39;t also be neglecting what we must do as we cope up with the current trends, needs
								and our own interests.<br>
								<br>
								
								To sum up, acknowledging the presence of an Outcomes-Based Education is beneficial to the teaching
								and learning process, the conventional way must not be forgotten because these two must be
								appreciated by both teachers and learners to have an effective learning.</p>
