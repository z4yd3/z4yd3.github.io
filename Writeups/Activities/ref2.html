                            <p>In this activity, our teachers tasked us to create a Word Cloud using the different concepts of
								Information and Communication Technologies. Upon doing it, we were able to recall what we have
								learned from our past discussions. And this visual tool is effective for us to transfer our learning in a
								creative way. </p>
							<br>
							<h2>Expectations and Insight about the course TTL1/ADTECH</h2>
							<p>I expect that in our course, Technology for Teaching and Learning 1, I will be learning a lot from the
								course itself and from the teacher. I know that this course will be a challenging one because we&#39;ll surely
								be struggling and face different trials as it&#39;s our first time to encounter this course. Also, I expected that
								this course will help me to learn more things about Technology. I expect that this course will serve as an
								opportunity for me to explore the broad term/ topic. Not only that I&#39;ll get to know more concepts about
								the topics to be discussed, but most specially to get the real essence of having this course in our
								program which is to help us become prepared and equipped with a firm knowledge in our future
								professions - teachers. In addition to, I&#39;ll expect that this course will help me to become informative,
								innovative, and creative person in all aspects of life as I apply what I have learned about Technology.</p>
								
								<p>There are a lot things I would like to learn in this course. Aside from the different concept of technology,
									I would like to learn how to become innovative and creative when it comes to coming up with the
									different effective strategies to be applied in teaching as my future profession. I like to expand my
									knowledge on the different effective tools to be used in building a connection and relationship towards
									my students as I teach them about this course someday. I like to know the real importance of studying
									this course and how it the presence as well as the absence of technology affects the teaching and
									learning process.</p>
